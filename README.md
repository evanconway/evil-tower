# Altered Platformer

This game is just a few basic mechanics with basic enemies. This is an exercise in discipline and organization. The goal is to make a complete game with all the features and dressings of something worthy of release. That includes things like full menus, dialog boxes, and of course solid game mechanics.

This is a game maker project. Although Game Maker is intuitive, I feel that the actual files are hard to understand when not viewed in game maker. Here's a small explanation of how things work:

99% of the code I've written is in the objects and scripts folders. For every object/script, there's a folder with gml files and a yy file. The gml files are what I've written, the yy is auto-generated by game maker. All objects in game maker are event driven. For example, the create event is called when an instance of the object is created. If you're interested in diving deeper, look at Create_0.gml and Step_0.gml of the various objects in the game.
